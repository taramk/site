new site design. i don't love it yet, but i'm working on it. i really want to use google webfonts&mdash;nothing beats free and easy&mdash;but none of them speak to me. sigh. i really want a kind of early 1900's gothic sans-serif. like [Bell Gothic](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/bell-gothic-bt/), but i'm not ready to pay for fonts yet.

maybe i should learn how to design typefaces. i don't have *that* much design knowledge... i usually just base my design decisions on how things feel. and type design seems a bit too technical to get by on intuition. maybe i'll learn.

in other interestingness, i'm trying to switch over to using HSLA instead of RGB. seems like a more intuitive way of choosing and editing compatible colors. Steven Bradley posted [a great video](http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/hsl-color-tool-github/) about his experience learning to use it, along with a tool he made. definitely going to spend some time playing with it. and now that i have [CSS Snippets](http://joshnh.com/2012/02/03/a-collection-of-css-snippets-for-sublime-text-2/) installed, i don't have to type it out every time.

yay.
