while making a mobile version of jeff's website, i noticed he uses jekyll to organize his blog. it seems really simple, and i don't have to rely on some complicated software or set up a database. and it seems pretty portable if i ever decide to go with something else. going to look into prose.io as well, for a browser-based content editor. just have to start using git for my site, which i should be doing anyway. oy.
