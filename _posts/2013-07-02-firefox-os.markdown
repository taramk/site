is anyone as excited as i am about [firefox OS](http://robertnyman.com/2013/07/02/the-launch-of-firefox-os-my-thoughts-and-some-history/)? i totally wanna make apps, but objective-C makes my eyes glaze over. i'm sorry. i really have tried. and i see the advantages to learning lower-level languages, it's just so much more _stuff_ to write. and maybe i've been a bit spoiled.

my iphone is pretty and all, but i think i'll always resent apple for being so controlling.
